# Exploratory-data-analysis
This repository contains a performance optimization dataset. Exploring the data, cleaning, pre-processing, encoding, feature engineering, cross-correlations have been focused. This is mainly preparing the data for machine learning analysis. The cleaned dataset is finally extracted.

The dataset is based on a simulated thin film deposition dataset that I have generated. While the general characteristics of the data are realistic, they don't correspond to any real process / technology.
